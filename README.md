Search Engine
This project implements a basic search engine that indexes a collection of text documents and allows users to perform efficient and relevant searches through a clean user interface. It integrates natural language processing techniques and ranking algorithms to provide meaningful results.

Project Overview
The goal is to design and implement a mini search engine for a given corpus of textual data. The engine supports advanced query capabilities, ranking, and relevance-based improvements through query expansion.

Features
Text preprocessing (tokenization, case normalization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Inverted index for efficient term-based search

TF-IDF-based ranking of search results

Query parsing and relevance-based expansion

Integration with word embeddings (ELMo or BERT) for improved search performance

Basic GUI for query input and result display
